# Unit 2 Responsiveness Portfolio

Welcome to my Responsiveness Portfolio! I have built a responsive, styled basic web portfolio using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 

## HTML 
To begin, I created an HTML file for the home page of my website. I added a navigation bar that I styled with Bootstrap and CSS. The Navigation bar has links that will take you to all of the website pages. Further the nave bar includes an active link that will show you the current page you are viewing! The main tags on each page contain the main content. 

## Bootstrap
