# Unit 2 Responsiveness Portfolio

Welcome to my Responsiveness Portfolio! I have built a responsive, styled, basic web portfolio using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 

## HTML 
To begin, I created HTML files for the each page of my website. I added my Bootstrap, CSS style sheet, and Google Fonts links to my HTML head so that I could pull from those links. The main tags on each page contain the main content. 

## Bootstrap
In order to create the responsive framework needed, I employed Bootstrap. Through the use of the grid system's rows and columns, I created a more defined layout on each page of my website. For example, I used Bootstrap to create a nav bar that allowed me house links for each page of my website. In addition, that nav bar is responsive and the links combine into a single dropdown instead of individual links at smaller screen sizes. As for the responsive layout, the content displays with margins on small and larger screens, however the content takes up the whole screen when viewed on an extra small screen. 

## CSS 
Finally, I employed CSS to provide the styling for my page. Elements like the background color, background image, fonts, image sizes, and footer styling are all controlled by targeting the classes in the HTML. 

## Acknowledgements 
I was able to complete this assignment in part due to the expertise of my fellow classmates Jonathan Canales, Jason Ozulumba, and Alexander Fleming! Being able to bounce ideas off of a group with a little bit more coding experience and hearing how they worked through problems helped me to learn how to frame questions and learn a lot of new techniques in general!
